# bikesharing

**Overview of the Analysis**

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
  * Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  * Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

  * Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
  * Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
  * Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

**Summary**

Looking further at the demographic population, to view the gender count of the participants, birth year of the participants and birth year by gender of the participants. These images depict further demographic information which can assist Des Moines in marketing to groups that the most likely to participate but also change their marketing to be more inclusive. It appears males are the more likely gender to participate in the program, so marketing techniques may need to be changed to emphasize safety or discounted rates for traveling in groups. Additionally, the most likely age to participate in the program is 1970 and 1990. These numbers make sense with a tail on either side of the peaks because as the demographic gets younger they are less likely to pariticipate in the program and when the demographic gets older they are also less likely to participate in the program. So in this instance it is recommended for the business to design makreting around the "middle-age" and "young adult" market because they are the population that is the most likely to participate anyways.
